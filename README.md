MixSIAR is an R package that helps you create and run Bayesian mixing models to analyze biotracer data (i.e. stable isotopes, fatty acids), following the [MixSIAR model framework](https://peerj.com/articles/5096/). MixSIAR represents a collaborative coding project between the investigators behind MixSIR, SIAR, and IsoSource: Brice Semmens, Brian Stock, Eric Ward, Andrew Parnell, Donald Phillips, and Andrew Jackson.

MixSIAR incorporates several years of advances in Bayesian mixing model theory since MixSIR and SIAR, currently:

- Any number of biotracers (examples with 1 isotope, 2 isotope, 8 fatty acids, and 22 fatty acids)
- Source data fit hierarchically within the model
- Source data by categorical covariate (e.g. sources by Region)
- Categorical covariates (up to 2, choice of modeling as random or fixed effects, either nested or independent)
- Continuous covariate (up to 1)
- Error structure options with covariance (Residual * Process, Residual only)
- Concentration dependence
- Plot and include "uninformative"/generalist or informative priors
- Fit multiple models and compare relative support using LOO/WAIC weights

For details, please see the [MixSIAR paper](https://peerj.com/articles/5096/):

- Full description of equations
- Advice/explanation on 4 common issues (error structures, priors, combining sources, covariates)
- Case study highlighting new functionality (model selection with LOO/WAIC weights)

## Installation

The GUI has been removed from the CRAN version of MixSIAR (if desired, see MixSIARgui). Running MixSIAR with scripts is easier to install and better for repeated analysis.

1. Download and install/update [R](https://cran.r-project.org/).

2. Download and install [JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/).

3. Open R and run:
```
install.packages("MixSIAR", dependencies=TRUE)
library(MixSIAR)
```

## Tutorial

We suggest walking through the [vignettes](http://brianstock.github.io/MixSIAR/articles/index.html) to familiarize yourself with MixSIAR.

There is also an extensive user manual included in the package install. To find the directory location on your computer:
```
find.package("MixSIAR")
```

Alternatively, you can download the manual from the GitHub site [here](https://github.com/brianstock/MixSIAR/blob/master/inst/mixsiar_manual_small.pdf).

Clean, runnable `.R` scripts for each vignette are also available in the `example_scripts` folder of the `MixSIAR` package install:
```
library(MixSIAR)
mixsiar.dir <- find.package("MixSIAR")
file.path(mixsiar.dir, "example_scripts")
```

You can then run the Wolves example script with:
```
setwd("choose/where/to/save/output")
source(file.path(mixsiar.dir, "example_scripts", "mixsiar_script_wolves.R"))
```
